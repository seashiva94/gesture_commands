# GESTURE COMMANDS:

A generic module that helps me define gesture comands for my laptop/internet 
connection with the help of object tracking.

Potentially be used along with a raspberryPi + MQTT
to monitor and perform tasks remotely (to fecilitate laziness)
Some tasks include: 
	- Volume control on TV
	- watering the plants
	- opeining/closing windows
	- find my phone

The aim of this project is to brush up on CV ans SE skills while having fun.
